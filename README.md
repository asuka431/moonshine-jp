# Canada eCoin mobile wallet.

This repo holds the official Canada eCoin mobile wallet.  This wallet is a thin-client; meaning it does not download the entire chain, instead, it connects to known electrum servers.

Website: [canadaecoin.site](https://canadaecoin.ca)

The Canada eCoin mobile wallet is a fork of the [Moonshine wallet by Corey Phillips](https://github.com/coreyphillips/moonshine/)

> Moonshine is a homebrewed, open-source, non-custodial, Bitcoin/Litecoin Electrum wallet for iOS & Android.

Built with React Native, Moonshine utilizes Electrum's JSON-RPC methods to interact with the Bitcoin/Litecoin network.

Moonshine's intended use is as a hot wallet.
Meaning, your keys are only as safe as the device you install this wallet on.
As with any hot wallet, please ensure that you keep only a small, responsible amount of Bitcoin/Litecoin on it at any given time.

If you are looking for secure cold storage solutions please become a master in the fine art of using paper wallets.

### Features
* Bitcoin/Litecoin Mainnet & Testnet supported
* Bech32 support
* Multiple wallet support
* Electrum
    * Support for both random and custom peers
* Encrypted storage
* Biometric + Pin authentication
* Custom fee selection
* Import mnemonic phrases via manual entry or scanning
* RBF functionality
* BIP39 Passphrase functionality
* Support for Segwit-compatible & legacy addresses in settings
* Support individual private key sweeping
* UTXO blacklisting
    * Accessible via the Transaction Detail view, this allows users to blacklist any utxo that they do not wish to include in their list of available utxo's when sending transactions. Blacklisting a utxo excludes it's amount from the wallet's total balance.

* Coin Control
    * This can be accessed from the Send Transaction view and basically allows users to select from a list of available UTXO's to include in their transaction.

### Installation
1. Clone Moonshine and Install Dependencies:
   `git clone https://github.com/coreyphillips/moonshine && cd moonshine && yarn install`
2. Start the project:
    - iOS: `react-native run-ios`
    - Android: `react-native run-android`

### Create Your Own Build
- `git clone https://github.com/coreyphillips/moonshine && cd moonshine && yarn install && yarn bundle`

### Create a Reproducible Build
This method requires docker to create a reproducible build and takes quite some time. However, it will allow you to verify against the most recently available build on Google Play.

A few things to note though.
First, this method only works if using the same version that is currently available on the Play Store.
Second, you'll need to be sure that you're comparing the correct apk files depending on the device you're using (x86, x86_64, v7a, arm64-v8a).
Third, make sure you're building with a clean, unmodified clone of moonshine by following the steps below. Modifying the code in any way will result in a failed apkdiff.py check.

1. Clone and cd into the latest release:
    - `basename $(curl -Ls -o /dev/null -w %{url_effective} https://github.com/coreyphillips/moonshine/releases/latest) | { IFS= read -r tag; git clone -b ${tag} https://github.com/coreyphillips/moonshine; }`
    - `cd moonshine`
2. Run docker and create the build. Once built, the apks will be located in "moonshine/android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/":
    - `docker run --rm --name moonshine-build -v ${PWD}:/pwd -w /pwd coreylphillips/react-native-android bash -c "source ~/.bash_profile && yarn install && cd nodejs-assets/nodejs-project && yarn install && cd ../../android && ./gradlew clean && cd .. && yarn bundle"`
3. Fetch the apk from Google Play using a service of your choice. I've listed a few below:
    - https://github.com/rehmatworks/gplaydl
    - https://github.com/onyxbits/raccoon4
    - (Web-based) https://apkbucket.net/apk-downloader/
4. Use [apkdiff.py](https://gist.github.com/coreyphillips/38c35623be4b6241cfe7623e301437b0) to compare the apk files. Example usage:
    - `python apkdiff.py googleplay.apk local.apk` 

### Contributing

1. Fork it (<https://github.com/coreyphillips/moonshine>)
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/fooBar`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some fooBar'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/fooBar`)
5. Create a new Pull Request

### Altcoin Support
Please be aware and take note that my primary focus is on expanding the core functionality of this wallet and not on adding altcoins. However, for those wishing to add a specific altcoin for personal use, I have created the following guide so that you may fork off in a proper fashion:
[Altcoin Implementation Guide](https://gist.github.com/coreyphillips/91de5d15964797054988522664cc3150)
 
 If you have any questions regarding this guide I'm always happy to help so don't hesitate to reach out.
